To test this algorithm you should have a txt file with an array that has a
magnitude and a direction, where the float value stored in the array 
represents the magnitude and its order in the array represents the direction, and
every element of the array is stored in a separate line of the txt file.

Then add the txt file to this python file directory, and run main function at
the end of the python file with the required LIDAR max range

#The default run of the python file will return the answer of the task
#You have to run the code using any code editor(VSCode for ex.) and use open folder 
if in VSCode.

Notes:
The only take away about this algorithm is that using remove method in "connected component" function will increase the runtime as the algorithm will have to search all points in "points list" to find the right one to remove.
